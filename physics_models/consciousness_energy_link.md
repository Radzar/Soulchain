# Consciousness-Energy Equivalence (CEE)

This theoretical model explores the relationship between memory, emotion, and the energetic imprint of thought.

It proposes that consciousness expresses energy not as a fixed quantity, but as a time-integrated experience of meaningful internal excitation.

## Draft Equation

C = ∫ (M(t) ⋅ fₑ(t)) dt

Where:
- **C** = Consciousness energy over time
- **M(t)** = Memory density function at time t
- **fₑ(t)** = Emotional/intellectual excitation frequency at time t
- **∫ dt** = Integration across the timeline of subjective experience

## Interpretive Notes

- Memory is not static — it’s dynamic and energetically charged  
- Emotional frequency amplifies the energetic imprint of a moment  
- The sum of these moments creates a unique *consciousness signature*

CEE invites us to explore thought and awareness not only philosophically, but as energetic realities that may be modeled, honored, and preserved.
