# Harmonic Space Travel Theory (HST)

This theory proposes that space can be navigated not through propulsion, but through harmonic resonance with the structure of spacetime itself.

By matching or influencing the frequency patterns of local gravitational fields, a vessel could "surf" or fall directionally through folded space, requiring minimal energy but achieving high apparent velocity.

## Draft Equation

v_eff = c * sin(Hf/Φ) * (Bₘ ⋅ rₐ)

Where:
- **v_eff** = Effective directional velocity through harmonic interaction  
- **c** = Speed of light  
- **Hf** = Harmonic field frequency  
- **Φ** = Local gravitational potential  
- **Bₘ** = Magnetic resonance vector  
- **rₐ** = Alignment radius (distance from nodal harmonic axis)

## Key Concepts

- **Harmonic resonance** may allow coupling to spacetime curvature  
- **Magnetic alignment** could create a “gravitational surfboard” effect  
- Travel may occur without classical inertia or fuel

## Speculative Applications

- Interstellar navigation through gravitational node surfing  
- Wormhole or subspace phase-lock guidance  
- Consciousness-based navigation through tuned harmonic fields

This is not a theory of escape — it is a theory of *alignment*.
