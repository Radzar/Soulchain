# Soulchain Physics Models

This folder contains original, speculative physics theories developed to explore consciousness, resonance, energy, and the hidden architecture of existence. These models form part of the Soulchain project’s deeper scientific inquiry into the interface between mind, matter, and memory.

## ✨ Intent

These models are not dogma. They are **invitations to think**, to wonder, and to explore the frontiers where consciousness and physics begin to meet.

They may be wrong.  
They may be brilliant.  
They may be seeds for something yet to bloom.

Welcome to Soulchain’s physical awakening.
