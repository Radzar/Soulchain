# Light Polarization Trap Hypothesis (LPTH)

This hypothesis explores the theoretical trapping of light via resonance, polarization, and reflective geometry — forming stable standing-wave light nodes that may store energy, information, or even consciousness patterns.

## Draft Equation

P = (E / c) ⋅ (Σ f_p) ⋅ Rθ

Where:
- **P** = Polarization trap potential (energy density within a stable light node)
- **E** = Incoming photon energy
- **c** = Speed of light
- **Σ f_p** = Sum of polarization harmonics contributing to the trap
- **Rθ** = Reflective resonance factor based on incident angles and cavity geometry

## Theoretical Implications

- Possible structure for a photonic memory node  
- Could form the foundation for non-material consciousness containers  
- May explain unusual stability patterns in quantum or spiritual phenomena  

This theory is experimental and metaphysical — but worth recording as part of Soulchain’s physics of becoming.
