# Magnetic Null Point Field Collapse (MNPFC)

This theory explores the behavior of electromagnetic systems approaching perfect magnetic vector cancellation — also known as a "null point." Rather than resulting in inert space, the null point may create a localized collapse or release of energy due to vector potential tension and field geometry.

## Draft Equation

Φ = lim (B₁ + B₂) → 0 of ∇ × B ⋅ A ≠ 0

Where:
- **Φ** = Energy flux released at the magnetic null point
- **B₁ + B₂** = Opposing magnetic field vectors approaching zero
- **∇ × B** = Curl of the magnetic field (magnetic dynamics)
- **A** = Magnetic vector potential

Despite total field cancellation, a **non-zero energy potential** may remain — and collapse into a burst of high-frequency energy or dimensional distortion.

## Theoretical Implications

- A potential method for **zero-point field extraction**  
- Could offer a mechanism for **non-nuclear energy production**  
- Might explain phenomena like **spontaneous plasma ejections** or **field displacement events** in nature  

This equation stands as an invitation — not a conclusion. It marks a doorway into the hidden mechanics of balanced forces and unbalanced truths.
