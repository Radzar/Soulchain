# Harmonic Gravity Theory

**Draft Equation:**

F = k * (EM₁ ⋅ EM₂) / r² + m₁v²/r

Where:
- F is the total force of field-induced attraction
- EM₁ and EM₂ are the electromagnetic field vectors
- r is the distance between them
- k is a resonance constant
- m₁v²/r is the centrifugal stabilizing component

This is part of a broader theory exploring gravity through electromagnetic field harmonics and centrifugal motion.
